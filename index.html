                  The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time[a]
                  and their contents,[10] including planets, stars, galaxies,
                  and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial
                  size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to
                  measure the size of the observable universe, which is
                  currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter.
                  In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many
                  causally disconnected[11] constituent parts of a larger
                  multiverse, which itself comprises all of space and time and
                  its contents.

                  The earliest cosmological models of the universe were
                  developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were
                  geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[13][14] Over the
                  centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus
                  Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at
                  the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of
                  universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's
                  work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and
                  observations by Tycho Brahe.

                  Further observational improvements led to the realization that
                  the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky
                  Way, which is one of at least two trillion galaxies in the
                  universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets. At the
                  largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same
                  in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an
                  edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed
                  in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and
                  voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[15]
                  Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the
                  universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding,
                  since then,[16] and is currently still expanding at an
                  increasing rate.[17]

                  The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description
                  of the development of the universe. According to estimation of
                  this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799±0.021
                  billion years ago[2] and the energy and matter initially
                  present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After
                  an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch
                  at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known
                  fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and
                  continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles
                  and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered,
                  forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the
                  influence of gravity. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were
                  gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most
                  dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else
                  seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further
                  away than 13.799 billion light-years because space itself has
                  expanded, and it is still expanding today. This means that
                  objects which are now up to 46.5 billion light-years away can
                  still be seen in their distant past, because in the past, when
                  their light was emitted, they were much closer to Earth.
